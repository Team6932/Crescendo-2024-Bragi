/*
 * This is a command used for shooting towards the speaker. 
 * PassCommand and AmpCommand are the exact same (same comments and criticisms).
 * 
 * I have created two improved versions of shooting commands. They are under the ImprovedCommands folder. 
 * ImprovedSpeakerShootCommand.java provides a better way for programming a command that only shoots at the speaker.
 * ImprovedGeneralShootCommand.java provides a better way for programming a command that can shoot at multiple settings.
